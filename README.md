# YouTube Emotions



## Project Overview
The development of the sentiment analysis program for classifying and filtering YouTube comments provided valuable learning opportunities and practical experience with key programming concepts. This project involved working with textual data, to solve real-world problems, such as automating emotion detection and regional filtering. In this program, I used 2 datasets (a keywords dataset, and CSV files) Through this, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing python functions, using dictionaries and lists, and managing complex data structures to handle large volumes of text data.

Additionally, the project required extensive text processing to clean and analyze comments for sentiment classification. I worked with TSV and CSV files for data storage and manipulation, leveraging Python's file input and output capabilities to read, process, and write data efficiently. Exception handling was implemented to manage errors and ensure the program adhered to specifications under varying conditions. 
This project reinforced the importance of writing clear, maintainable code that adheres to specifications, while addressing the challenges of working with real-world, unstructured data. The experience provided practical insights into software development processes, such as debugging, testing, and optimization, ultimately improving my problem-solving skills and understanding of scalable text-processing solutions.



## Results
The sentiment analysis system successfully categorized YouTube comments into six emotions (anger, joy, fear, trust, sadness, and anticipation) and filtered them by country, revealing regional variations and trends. It demonstrated high efficiency in processing large datasets and provided actionable insights into emotional patterns across different types of content.


## Dependencies
This program requires Python 3.x
